<!--What This Shows
Blue = unvisited
Purple = visited
Red = hover
Orange = active (clicked)
Custom link still keeps contrast and visited state.
Links have five important states:
✔ 1. :link — Unvisited link
This styles the link before the user clicks it.
✔ 2. :visited — Visited link
Shows users which pages they have already opened.
✔ 3. :hover — Mouse over link
Helps users recognize that the link is interactive.
✔ 4. :focus — Keyboard focused link
Important for accessibility and navigating with the keyboard (Tab key).
✔ 5. :active — While the link is being clicked
Gives instant feedback during the click.-->
